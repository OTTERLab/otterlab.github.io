# Open-source Technologies & Theory for Experimental Research (OTTER) Laboratories
---
OTTER Laboratories is a research group focused on developing advanced tools and technologies using `Python`, `C++`, `C`, and other emerging technologies. We aim to build secure, efficient systems while exploring cutting-edge innovations in software engineering, systems design, security, and computational research. Our focus is on cutting-edge fields that push the boundaries of what's possible, while also providing robust support to the institution. Through research and experimentation, we aim to create long-lasting impacts on industries ranging from AI to cybersecurity, and beyond.

## Recruitment & Opportunities

We are actively recruiting passionate and dedicated students who are eager to contribute to our mission. If you are a student with a strong interest in technology, research, and innovation, we want to hear from you.

### What We Are Looking For:

1. Drive & Focus: We want people who are committed to making a real impact in tech and research.

2. Adaptability & Growth: We need individuals who are eager to learn, adapt quickly, and thrive in a fast-paced environment. Your ability to contribute and grow is key.

3. Team Player: Collaboration is central here. We’re looking for those who are ready to work with others, communicate effectively, and help get projects off the ground.

We’re looking for students who are willing to learn, code (experience is helpful but not required), and have a general understanding of highschool level-math. Meetings will be held on Wednesdays during the spring semester. Your time is valuable, and flexibility is respected, but communication is key.
